                <p>Loan Servicing is an integral part of the owner finance industry today.</p>
                <p>Our role is to collect a monthly payment, distribute funds to any underlying lender first then to the seller, handle tax and insurance escrow, if any, and send out late notices.</p>
                <p>We act as a fraud preventer by ensuring that any underlying mortgage payment paid first before the seller receives any money. Loan Servicers are rapidly becoming a mainstay in the owner finance industry and they also help to normalize the transaction for the buyers.</p>
